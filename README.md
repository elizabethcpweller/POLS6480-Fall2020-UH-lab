# POLS6480-Fall2020-UH-lab
This github repository is where I will post student resources for the fall 2020 session of the POLS 6480 - Quantitative Methods I graduate course at University of Houston.

I am teaching the lab portion, so this will include all lab code and assignments.

It will also include some code from class as appropriate. 

I will post general information. resources, and cheat sheets on statistics and tech solutions including R, LaTex, LaTex editors, Github, Slack, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Mendeley, Zotero, Obsidian.md, calendar and time management apps, and any others that may be useful.

Finally, I'll post a few general interest items for first year political science grad students.
